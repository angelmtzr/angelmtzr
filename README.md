<p align="justify" >
I'm a third-year engineering student interested in software development, process optimization and business. I like to work in teams, learn from others, and help others, because I am certain that all of this will help me become not only a better person but also a better professional. In practice, I specially like builidng projects oriented to practical applications and/or business purposes. Learning new things fascinates me: I believe it's a powerful way of discovering new tools to solve almost any kind of problem.
