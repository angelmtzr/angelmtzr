### Hi there, I'm Angel 👋

I'm a Computer Science student interested in software development, process optimization and business. I like to work in teams, learn from others, and help others, because I am certain that all of this will help me become not only a better person but also a better professional. In practice, I specially like builidng projects oriented to practical applications and/or business purposes. Learning new things fascinates me: I believe it's a powerful way of discovering new tools to solve daily problems.

- 👨‍💻 RPA Development Engineer at VALEO IT.
- 🐍 My favorite programming languages are Python and C#.
- 💬 I speak Spanish, English, German, and a little French.
- 🎻 Fun fact: I have played the violin since I was 7.
